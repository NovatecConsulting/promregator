# Promregator's Endpoints

Promregator exposes the following endpoints:

| Path | Used in Mode | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `/metrics` | Single Endpoint Scraping | triggers service discovery, calls the metrics endpoints of the CF app instances, merges the samples enriching it with [additional labels](enrichment.md), and adds scraping metrics |
| `/discovery` | Single Target Scraping | triggers service discovery and returns a `file_sd_configs`-compatible response |
| `/singleTargetMetrics` | Single Target Scraping | triggers scraping of metrics from the CF app instance specified, enriching the result with additional labels |
| `/promregatorMetrics` | Single Target Scraping | exposes (global) scraping metrics generated by Promregator |
